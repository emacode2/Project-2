# Project-2

This is a full CRUD application built with Mongoose, Express, Handlebars and Node.

I have named it Communifit. It is an app used by residents of thesame neighborhood or community to build healthy habits and increase social interaction.

It will be created using thesame style and functionality as craigslist, with 2 non-user models. These will be posts and comments.

It will use 2 non-user models. A user will post an event; a run for example, set to meet at a common public area and time. Other users can reply by commenting under each post.

The posts will be full CRUD with
title
description
status.
and the comments will have create, read and update.

status

THe app will be deployed to Heroku.
